                    <p>A student of computing with great interest in the field of IT. Hi! I'm Biju Acharju, resident of Dharan, Nepal. I started learning about computer since 2012 when I was at very young age. My interest on computer and morden technologies grew more and more. When I decided to be the part of this tech world, I started my journey as a Web Designer on different crowd-sourcing platforms like 99designs, deisgn crowd, crowd spring, etc. as a freelancer.
                        And later I also started learning about different Objected-Oriented Programming Languages like Java, Python, C++, etc. to develop my professional skills as a Web | Software developer. Now, with the research and practise that I did, I am known as Professional Web | Software Developer and Designer.
